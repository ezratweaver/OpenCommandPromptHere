### A Batch Script to Add the Only Good Feature in Windows 11, Back Into Windows 10!

This super simple script will re-add the only feature I found useful on windows 11! It adds the <br> ability to right click in any folder and open that directory in Windows Terminal. Additionally <br>  it also sets Windows Terminal as the default for opening batch scripts.
